# Pancreatic-Adenocarcinoma
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma is the third most common cause of death from cancer, with an overall 5-year survival rate of less than 5%, and is predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States by 2030. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation and expression of genes. RNA and DNA are nucleic acids, and, along with lipids, proteins and carbohydrates, constitute the four major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. RNA-Seq (RNA sequencing), is a sequencing technique to reveal the presence and quantity of RNA in a biological sample at a given moment. Here we have a dataset of normalized RNA Sequencing reads for pancreatic cancer tumors. The measurement consists of ~20,000 genes for 185 pancreatic cancer tumors. The file format is GCT , a tab-delimited file used for sharing gene expression data and metadata (details for each sample) for samples.
